### KF-ABCD09-AM.txt
Varves AM 3297-4181.Connecticut Valley, Kelsey Ferguson Brickyard, Redland Brick Co., South Windsor, Conn. as published in Stone and others (2005) and expanded in 2009. NEVC and NAVC records measured by Jack Ridge, Laura Carter, Jeremy Wei, and Chris Smith from outcrop cores (summer, winter, and total couplet thickness). Five adjacent outcrop transects of identical thicknesses were fused to form the varve record.

### MASSRR
NEVC and NAVC varve records at the River Road section, South Deerfield, Massachusetts by George Thomas (1984) and Laura Levy (1998). Data files include:

- RRThom84.TXT � Varves NE 5103-5238. Digitized from graph in Thomas (1984).
- RRThomas1984-AM.TXT Varves AM 5118-5254 
- RRLevy98.TXT � Varves NE 5008-5201
- RRLevy98-AM.TXT Varves AM 5022-5217

### MILLBK-AM.txt
Varves AM 5767-6039, NEVC and NAVC varve records from Mill Brook, Connecticut Valley, Putney, VT. Measured at outcrop by Jack Ridge.

### NEWBURY
Folder with data files from Newbury, VT, Connecticut Valley site #73 of Antevs (1922), fully measured in outcrop cores as reported in Ridge and Toll (1999). 
Cumulative uncertainty above NE 7510 at 8676 (AM 7192-8358) is +35/-20. (summer, winter, and total couplet thickness)

- NEWBswT.TXT, Varves NE 6944-8676, Newbury, VT.
- NEWBswT-AM.TXT, Varves AM 6627-8358, Newbury, VT.
- NEWB5yr.TXT, 5-yr running average of total varve thickness for the Newbury, VT. section (NE version NEWBswT.TXT listed above).
- NEWB5yr-AM.TXT, 5-yr running average of total varve thickness for the Newbury, VT. section (AM version NEWBswT-AM.TXT listed above).

### VTWellsR

Folder contains 5 outcrop records from the Wells River Valley near Wells River, VT. These records form four sequences (A-oldest to D-youngest) with some gaps that span approximately 520 years. Only crude matches have been found between the sequences and the upper Connecticut varves of the NEVC or NAVC. Deposition in the Wells River Valley was in a tributary embayment of the glacial lake in the Connecticut Valley and the Wells River Valley became an environment where deposition was dominated by meteoric input to the lake with no or very minor glacial runoff. Summer layers in the Wells River Valley are beds deposited by summer runoff events and winter layers are frequently interrupted by sand partings and layers that probably represent late summer precipitation events in an environment where clay deposition begins in the late summer. As a result, annual layers are difficult to interpret and these records are very difficult to measure accurately. Thus, it is very difficult to confidently match the records to the NEVC or NAVC, which are formulated from records of glacial varves dominated by glacial runoff deposition. The approximate time of deglaciation in this area, very crude intermittent matches with the NEVC and NAVC in places, overall trends in varve thickness, and some key event horizons (especially NE7500 or AM7182 associated with a prominent change in varve lithology) suggest the following tentative correlations:

- Sequence A (201-450) in WR1AswT.TXT and WR2AswT.TXT = NE 7090-7340 or AM 6772-7022
- 1-yr gap between sequences A and B
- Sequence B (1-23) in WR1BswT.TXT = NE 7342-7364 or AM 7024-7046
- 2-yr gap between sequences B and C
- Sequence C (1-90) in WR1CswT.TXT = NE 7367-7456 or AM 7049-7138
- 20-yr gap between sequences C and D
- Sequence D (1-133) in WR1DswT.TXT = NE 7475-7607 or AM 7157-7289
