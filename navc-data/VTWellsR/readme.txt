Folder contains 5 outcrop records from the Wells River Valley near Wells River, VT. 
These records form four sequences (A-oldest to D-youngest) with some gaps that span approximately 520 years. 
Only crude matches have been found between the sequences and the upper Connecticut varves of the NEVC or NAVC. 
Deposition in the Wells River Valley was in a tributary embayment of the glacial lake in the Connecticut Valley and the Wells River Valley became an environment where deposition was dominated by meteoric input to the lake with no or very minor glacial runoff. 
Summer layers in the Wells River Valley are beds deposited by summer runoff events and winter layers are frequently interrupted by sand partings and layers that probably represent late summer precipitation events in an environment where clay deposition begins in the late summer. 
As a result, annual layers are difficult to interpret and these records are very difficult to measure accurately. 
Thus, it is very difficult to confidently match the records to the NEVC or NAVC, which are formulated from records of glacial varves dominated by glacial runoff deposition. 
The approximate time of deglaciation in this area, very crude intermittent matches with the NEVC and NAVC in places, overall trends in varve thickness, and some key event horizons (especially NE7500 or AM7182 associated with a prominent change in varve lithology) suggest the following tentative correlations:

Sequence A (201-450) in WR1AswT.TXT and WR2AswT.TXT = NE 7090-7340 or AM 6772-7022
1-yr gap between sequences A and B

Sequence B (1-23) in WR1BswT.TXT = NE 7342-7364 or AM 7024-7046
2-yr gap between sequences B and C

Sequence C (1-90) in WR1CswT.TXT = NE 7367-7456 or AM 7049-7138
20-yr gap between sequences C and D

Sequence D (1-133) in WR1DswT.TXT = NE 7475-7607 or AM 7157-7289
